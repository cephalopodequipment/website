title: Cosmos Validator
---

The Cephalopod Equipment validator runs secure and redundant hardware with a
Yubikey HSM in a Tier 3 Datacenter.

## Active Since Genesis

The Cephalopod Equipment validator was a proud [participant in the gentx ceremony](https://github.com/cosmos/launch/blob/master/gentx/cec.json)
of the Cosmos Hub and has been an active validator since the genesis block.

We recently upgraded our infrastructure and cycled validator signing and
operator keys.

## Tier 3 Datacenter

The Cephalopod Equipment validator is hosted on a private server in a tier 3 data center near
Toronto, Canada. Access to the data center is secured by government identity, an
access card, and biometrics.

## Validator Hardware

The Cephalopod Equipment validator runs on an enterprise grade server with
RAID-0 storage, TPM encrypted hard drives, and secure boot, with fully redundant
networking and power.

## Validator Signing

The Cephalopod Equipment validator uses a Yubikey HSM and the Tendermint KMS for
secure signing.

## Sentry Nodes

The Cephalopod Equipment validator runs on a private VPN guarded by multiple sentry nodes running on Amazon Web Services.

## Alerting

The Cephalopod Equipment validator and sentry nodes are closely monitored for
up-time and the team is alerted if any nodes go down.

## Operator Address

The Cephalopod Equipment operator address employs a 2-of-3 multisig.
